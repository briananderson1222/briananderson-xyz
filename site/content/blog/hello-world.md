summary: Kicking off my new site with SvelteKit, Markdown, and static hosting.
---

This site runs on **SvelteKit** with the static adapter so it can be uploaded to a cheap object store and fronted by a CDN.

Content is written in Markdown via **mdsvex** so I don't need to open raw HTML. Each post is a file under `content/blog/` with frontmatter.
